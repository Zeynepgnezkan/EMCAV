#' Process Eye-Tracking Trial Data
#'
#' This function processes eye-tracking trial data from a reading experiment. It performs various steps including sample filtering, downsampling, fixation detection (using the algorithm by Engbert & Kliegl, 2004, as implemented in the saccades package), fixation merging, and adding word information to the fixations.
#'
#' @param trial_samples A data frame containing eye-tracking samples for the trial.
#' @param trial_words A data frame containing word information for the trial.
#' @param trial_db_for_trial A data frame containing trial-level information for the trial.
#' @param use_eye Character indicating which eye to use for analysis ("L" for left, "R" for right).
#' @param min_duration_for_elimination Minimum duration (in milliseconds) for long fixations to be considered for elimination.
#' @param max_duration_for_elimination_or_merge Maximum duration (in milliseconds) for short fixations to be considered for elimination or merging.
#' @param max_distance_for_merge Maximum distance (in pixels) between fixations for merging.
#' @param sentence_start_x X-coordinate (in pixels) indicating the starting position of the sentence on the screen.
#' @param lambda Lambda parameter for fixation detection algorithm (see \code{\link[saccades]{detect.fixations}}.
#' @param smooth.coords Logical indicating whether to apply coordinate smoothing during fixation detection (see \code{\link[saccades]{detect.fixations}}.
#' @param smooth.saccades Logical indicating whether to apply saccade smoothing during fixation detection (see \code{\link[saccades]{detect.fixations}}.
#' @param downsampling_factor Downsampling factor for reducing the data. This is for evaluating the performance of the saccade detection algorithm with lower sampling rates.
#' @param downsampling_method What method to use to remove samples? Default is "drop": Keep every n-th sample. Alternative: "average": average over n samples (where n is the downsampling factor)
#'
#' @return A data frame containing fixations with added word information.
