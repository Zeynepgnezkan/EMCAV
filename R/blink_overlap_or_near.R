#' Evaluate Blink Overlap or Proximity to Fixation
#'
#' This function evaluates whether a single fixation and a single blink are close in time, indicating an overlap or proximity between them based on a specified time difference threshold.
#'
#' @param fixation_start Start timestamp of the fixation in milliseconds.
#' @param fixation_end End timestamp of the fixation in milliseconds.
#' @param blink_start Start timestamp of the blink in milliseconds.
#' @param blink_end End timestamp of the blink in milliseconds.
#' @param t_diff_threshold Time difference threshold (in milliseconds) for considering overlap or proximity.
#'
#' @return Logical value indicating whether the fixation and blink overlap or are near each other in time.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Check if a fixation and a blink are close
#' fixation_near_blink <- blink_overlap_or_near(100, 180, 190, 220, t_diff_threshold = 100)
