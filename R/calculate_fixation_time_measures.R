#' Calculate Fixation Time Measures
#'
#' This function calculates fixation time measures based on a data frame of fixations and associated word information. The calculated measures include measures related to first pass reading, gaze duration, and total viewing time for each word.
#'
#' @param fixations A data frame containing fixation data.
#' @param words A data frame containing word information.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing fixation time measures for each word. The resulting data frame includes the following columns:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{word_nr}{Word number associated with the fixation.}
#'   \item{ffd}{First Fixation Duration (in milliseconds) - Duration of the first fixation on the word.}
#'   \item{gd}{Gaze Duration (in milliseconds) - Total duration of fixations (first fixation and refixations) on the word during first-pass.}
#'   \item{sfd}{Single Fixation Duration (in milliseconds) - If the first fixation duration is equal to gaze duration, then SFD is the same as FFD, otherwise NA.}
#'   \item{gopast}{Go-past time (in milliseconds) - Total time spent from first entering word from the left to leaving word to the right, including any regressions. Also known as regression path duration.}
#'   \item{tvt}{Total Viewing Time (in milliseconds) - Total time spent on the word during the entire trial.}
#'   \item{word}{Word text associated with the word number.}
