#' Calculate Eye-Tracking Measures for a Subject
#'
#' This function calculates various eye-tracking measures for a subject's experimental trials. It processes each trial's eye-tracking data, performs downsampling if required, detects fixations using the Engbert & Kliegl (2004) algorithm as implemented in the \code{saccades} package, and calculates fixation-related measures such as fixation time measures and other trial-specific information.
#'
#' @param subject A list containing subject-level data elements, usually created by the \code{read_asc_file} function. The list should include the following elements:
#'   - `filename`: Character string representing the subject's filename or identifier.
#'   - `rate`: Character string specifying the recording sampling rate used in the experiment (e.g., "1000" for 1000 Hz).
#'   - `trial_db`: A data frame containing trial-level information for each trial in the experiment.
#'   - `trial_samples`: A list containing data frames, where each data frame represents eye-tracking samples for a trial.
#'   - `trial_words`: A list containing data frames, where each data frame holds word information for a trial.
#'   - `trial_fixations`: A list containing data frames, where each data frame contains fixation data for a trial (optional, used if \code{return_trial_fixations} is \code{TRUE}).
#'   - `trial_saccades`: A list containing data frames, where each data frame holds saccade information for a trial.
#'   - `trial_blinks`: A list containing data frames, where each data frame represents blink information for a trial.
#'
#'   These elements are used to process each trial's eye-tracking data and calculate fixation-related measures for analysis.
#' @param reduce_sampling_rate_to Numeric value specifying the target sampling rate after downsampling (Hz). \code{NULL} if no downsampling is desired.
#' @param downsampling_method Method used for downsampling. \code{drop} will keep one of every X samples (where X, the downsampling factor, is sampling rate/target sampling rate). \code{average} will average over every X samples.
#' @param lambda Lambda parameter for the Engbert & Kliegl (2004) fixation detection algorithm as implemented in the saccades package.
#' @param return_trial_fixations Logical indicating whether to return trial-specific fixation data.
#' @param use_eye Character indicating which eye to use for analysis ("L" for left, "R" for right).
#'
#' @return A data frame containing fixation time measures for each trial.
#' @return A list with fixation data frames for each trial (if \code{return_trial_fixations} is \code{TRUE}).
