\title{Categorize Fixations in a Sequence}
\usage{
categorize_fixation(sequence)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence}{A numeric vector representing a sequence of word numbers where fixations occurred.
Each number corresponds to a specific word in the text being read.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as the input \code{sequence}, with each element
indicating the category of the corresponding fixation: "first pass", "first pass refixation",
or "other fixation".
}
\description{
This function categorizes fixations in a given sequence of words into three categories:
"first pass", "first pass refixation", and "other fixation". The function uses the
unique occurrences of words to determine which fixations can be classified as first
pass fixations. A word can receive first pass fixations only once, and any subsequent
fixations on the same word are classified as refixations if they follow a first pass fixation.
}
\examples{
# Example sequence of fixations on words
fixation_sequence <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6)

# Categorize the fixations
categorized_fixations <- categorize_fixation(fixation_sequence)

# Print the results
print(categorized_fixations)
